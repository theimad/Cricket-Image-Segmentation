# Cricket-Image-Segmentation
We've provided the sample processed output dataset of the front camera view of Cricket from our algorithm from the paper, "DEEP-LEARNING-BASED COMPUTER VISION APPROACH FOR THE SEGMENTATION OF BALL DELIVERIES AND TRACKING IN CRICKET". We have chosen to provide intermediary output images samples of extracted front view to 1) avoid copyright issues which can arise from releasing unprocessed raw video, and 2) to make it easy for anyone who wants to further develop segmentation of ball deliveries. This will relieve the researchers and practitioners from extracting the most important part and view of the game of Cricket (the front view). Extraction of this part from raw video is a non-trivial task.
